    steps:
      # 1) Check out the repository at the exact tag/commit for this Release
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 1

      # 2) Remove the folders you do NOT want anywhere in the final artifact
      - name: Remove ignored folders
        run: |
          rm -rf .github
          rm -rf _playground

      # 3) (Node.js example) Set up Node, install deps, and build
      #    → If you use a different toolchain, replace these three steps
      - name: Set up Node.js v16.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "16"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # 4) Delete node_modules so it never ends up in the ZIP
      - name: Cleanup node_modules
        run: rm -rf node_modules

        # 5) Set up PHP & Composer (conditional PHP support)
      - name: Setup PHP (for Composer)

      # 6) If there is a composer.json, install & optimize vendor/

        if: ${{ hashFiles('composer.json') != '' }}
        run: |
          composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

      # 5) Archive EVERYTHING that remains (all folders/files + the build/ folder)
      #    Exclude the ZIP itself, so zip doesn’t recurse into itself.
      - name: Archive entire workspace
        id: archive

          ARTIFACT_NAME="${{ github.event.repository.name }}.zip"

          # Expose the filename as an output, so later steps can reference it
          echo "artifact_name=$ARTIFACT_NAME" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # 6) Upload the ZIP (named <repo-name>-<tag>.zip) to the Release
      - name: Upload ZIP to Release
