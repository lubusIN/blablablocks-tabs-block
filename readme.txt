Whether you’re building a documentation page, a product features section, or a clean tabbed layout for content organization, this plugin helps you do it quickly and natively.

### Why Choose BlaBlaBlocks Tabs Block?

The **Tabs Block** plugin combines **modern WordPress standards** with **ease of use**. Built using the **WordPress Interactivity API**, it ensures lightweight performance, accessibility, and full compatibility with the latest versions of WordPress.

#### Key Highlights

* Semantic markup that works with assistive technologies.

#### 2. Responsive by Design
No need for custom CSS or media queries. Tabs automatically adapt their layout across screen sizes:

#### 3. Horizontal & Vertical Tabs
Want sidebar-style navigation? Just toggle layout mode. You can switch between horizontal and vertical tabs at any time, perfect for documentation pages or feature lists.
